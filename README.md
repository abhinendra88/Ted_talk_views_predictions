This GitHub repository contains a predictive model for estimating the number of views a TED Talk is likely to receive. The model leverages machine learning techniques to analyze various features and patterns from a dataset of TED Talk presentations.  TED Talks are influential presentations on a wide range of topics.
TED stands for Technology, Entertainment and Design.

A TED talk refers to a recorded public-speaking presentation that was originally given at the main TED (technology, entertainment and design) annual event or one of its many satellite events around the world. TED is a nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks, often called "TED talks." These could be a motivational video, awareness, technical, Science entertainment, or any other genre.

TED is devoted to spreading powerful ideas on just about any topic. Founded in 1984 by Richard Salman as a nonprofit organization that aimed at bringing experts from the fields of Technology, Entertainment, and Design together, TED Conferences have gone on to become the Mecca of ideas from virtually all walks of life. As of 2015, TED and its sister TEDx chapters have published more than 2000 talks for free consumption by the masses and its speaker list boasts of the likes of Al Gore, Jimmy Wales, Shahrukh Khan, and Bill Gates.
